I'm Derek Beistad and this is an examination of the relationship between people's overall health and their proximity to natural areas (like parks and other outdoor areas).

According to the American Heart Association: consistent...

public parks provide a great...

This park at the bottom is from Shelby Bottoms in east Nashville, one of my favorite local parks.

the question driving this exploration is: Does having easy...

the AHA suggests...
******************************************************
I gathered park data consisting of 722 "parks" in or bordering TN. This includes parks, gardens, and forests.

Here we can see the number of each type of park in TN. We can also filter our map by this.

The health data was collected from 2020 and 2021 from the CDC and we focus on 8 different important health measures for adults 18 and older. they are: .....

this data was collected at 429 locations across TN.
***********************************************************
We can now explore these 429 locations by their proximity to parks. Notice that the closest location was inside a park, while the furthest was 52 km to the nearest park.

for simplicity, These locations were grouped into 3 categories: close medium, and far

by zooming in we can see better how these were made. We will examine the stats of these groups next.
************************************************************
by looking at the distribution of the locations' distances to their nearest park, we see that they are skewed right, which means a lot more of the locations are within 5km to a park than further than 15km away.

To make sure this does not skew our calculations, we will use quantiles to make 3 groups: close, medium, and far.
*************************************************************
We can now look at how each of the health measures change with distance to the nearest park.
...
notice how each measure has a positive, albeit small positive correlation and small R-Squared value, showing significance, 

we also see that the percentage of these health measures are slightly lower in the close category than in the far category, furthering the relationship.

these correlations are small, and there are many other factors that influence these measures.

While proximity to natural areas alone will not positively impact someone's health, it does provide easier access to free physical activity and fresh air.
*************************************************************
Overall we saw that there is a slight correlation between health and proximity to natural areas. It is important to note that correlation does not mean causation, many factors impact someone's health, being close to a natural area does not imply that the park was use by the locals regularly.

Even so, we did see a relationship there. more research should be done with more precise locations.

The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (30 minutes per day), but states that 300 minutes (1 hour per day) will increase the benefits. this includes a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and high blood pressure. We saw the same measures in our data.

moderate - intensity activities include: ....
