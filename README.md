# Motivation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
#### Does one's proximity to the outdoors affect their overall health?
<details>
   <summary>Investigate the relationship between living close to parks and someone's health</summary>
    
    Staying active is a crucial part of a healthy lifestyle. According to the American Heart Assocciation,
150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity can  "Lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2
diabetes, (and) high blood pressure..." [1]. With this information, we want to know if living closer (having
easy access) to a park will affects someone's overall health.
